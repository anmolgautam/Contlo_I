Step 3 - Set up Channels

You need to set up channels to receive support requests from your customers. Contlo supports the following channels:

- SMS
    - Follow the steps below to set up SMS on Contlo:
        1. On the Contlo dashboard, go to **App Market > Channels > SMS** and install the SMS application.
        2. Open the SMS application, and select Twilio as your SMS vendor. Click **Proceed**.
        3. On the **Account Authorization** screen, read and select the Terms and Conditions checkbox. Click **Proceed**.
        4. The One-Time Recharge modal opens up. Add the amount you want to add to your account and click **Submit**. Complete the transaction. (You can also add an amount for sending SMS via Twilio later).
            1. Contlo adds $ 2 to your account so that you can start conversations via SMS instantly. However as Twilio charges $ 0.15/SMS, you must add credit to your account for a seamless experience.
        5. Once the setup is complete, you can see your Twilio number and Consent Keywords on the SMS application homepage.
